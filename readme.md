# FFMPEG: Cut video

This is the repository for the article "[FFMPEG: Cut video causing A/V to not start together](https://fireattack.wordpress.com/2023/09/18/ffmpeg-cut-video-causing-a-v-to-not-start-together/)" on my blog.

The article is in Chinese, but feel free to ask any questions in English if you have any or find it useful.

It includes some video analysis and plot generation scripts, as well as some batch files used to generate all the test videos mentioned in the article.

It also includes a handy script "cut.py" which can be used to cut (stream copy) videos while avoiding issues mentioned in the very article.
